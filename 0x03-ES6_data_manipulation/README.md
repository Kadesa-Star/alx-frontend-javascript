# ES6 Data Manipulation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on key ES6 features for data manipulation, particularly working with arrays and advanced data structures like `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`. By the end of this project, you will be able to effectively use these structures and their associated methods for handling and processing data in modern JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone without relying on external resources:

- How to use **`map`**, **`filter`**, and **`reduce`** on arrays.
- What typed arrays are and how they work.
- How the **`Set`**, **`Map`**, and **`WeakMap`** data structures function.

## Requirements

- All files will be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**, **Visual Studio Code**.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A **README.md** file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Your code should use the **.js** extension.
- Code will be tested using **Jest** with the command:
  ```bash
  npm run test
