## Introduction
This project covers the fundamentals of ES6 (ECMAScript 6) Classes, focusing on object-oriented programming in JavaScript. By the end of this project, you’ll understand how to define and work with JavaScript classes, including adding methods, using static methods, inheritance, and metaprogramming with symbols.

## Resources
- [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
- [Metaprogramming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Meta_programming)
- Additional readings and documentation on the latest ECMAScript features.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts clearly:
- **How to define a Class:** Understand the syntax for creating a class in ES6, including the `constructor` method.
- **How to add methods to a class:** Learn how to define methods inside a class for encapsulating behavior.
- **Why and how to add a static method to a class:** Discover the use cases for static methods, which are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.
- **How to extend a class from another:** Understand inheritance and how to create subclasses using `extends` and `super`.
- **Metaprogramming and symbols:** Dive into advanced JavaScript techniques like proxies, reflection, and the use of `Symbol` for creating unique property keys.

## Project Structure
This project includes a series of tasks where you’ll implement and test various concepts related to ES6 Classes. Each task focuses on a specific feature of ES6 classes and object-oriented programming.

### Key Files
- `class_definition.js`: Defines basic class structure and instance methods.
- `static_methods.js`: Demonstrates how to add static methods to a class.
- `inheritance.js`: Explores class inheritance and the use of the `super` keyword.
- `metaprogramming.js`: A task focused on metaprogramming using proxies and symbols.

## Usage
To run the examples and exercises in this project:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to execute any file:

   ```bash
   node <filename>.js
